### What I learned
I'm very happy that I implemented CSS Grid correctly in this project. Here is a snippet of my first try with it. 

```css
  .grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-columns: 20.5em 20.5em;
    grid-template-rows: 21.875em 21.875em;
    column-gap: 1.5em;
    row-gap: 3.75em;
    place-content: center;
    margin-bottom: 9em;
  }
```


### Continued development

This was first time implementing CSS Grid (successfully lol) So I'm very proud that I got over the fear of it and just used it and researched when I came across problems.  
 
Going forward I want to use CSS Grid on more projects and continue experimenting with more complex layouts.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Background-Position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This helped me to get a better understanding of the background-position propery 
- [MDN Basic concepts of grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout) - This project was the first one where I actually gave css grid a try and I'm so happy I did. This was an amazing resource to refer to when I had question.
- [W3 Schools CSS Grid Layout Module](https://www.w3schools.com/CSS/css_grid.asp) - This was another resource i used to learn about grid and all the cool things it can do.
